# Job Applications Tracker

JobQueue helps by allowing users to:

	1.	Save job posting links while on the go.
	2.	Filter and verify genuine postings.
	3.	Compile job links to apply later when they have time to prepare their resume and other application materials.
	4.	Make the job application process quicker and more efficient.

Imagine you are traveling or at a boring place, and you come across a job posting that interests you. With JobQueue, you can save the job posting link on the go, filter and verify genuine postings, and compile job links to apply later when you have time to prepare your resume and other application materials.
